arLCD firmware and filesystem for the ezLCD + Arduino Touchscreen Magic
The arLCD when released was one of the first Arduino at Heart products and the first dual processor (not dual core) Arduino compatible product. It features an Arduino Uno design married to an ezLCD-3x smart LCD from Earth Computer Technologies division EarthLCD. Absolutely the easiest way to create a embedded touchscreen product.
